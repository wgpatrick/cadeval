description: "This is a hollow torus, or a circular pipe. The hollow, circular section is 10mm in outer diameter and is 2mm in thickness. The total, outer diameter of the torus is 60mm. (40mm inner diameter)."
reference_stl: "./reference/task7.stl" # Path relative to project root, ensure the STL file exists here.
requirements:
  bounding_box: [60,60,10] # Target dimensions [Length, Width, Height] in mm, consistent order. Calculate from reference STL.
  topology_requirements: # Optional section
    expected_component_count: 2 # Corrected: Torus has 2 components topologically.
