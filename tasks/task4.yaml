description: "I'm building a metal pin. It's a single part created using 3 operations. 

1. First, for the head of the pin, it's a simple cylinder. The cylinder is 35 mm in diameter and 20mm thick. 

2. Then for the shaft of the pin, there's another cylinder that's 20mm in diameter and 60mm long. So the total length of the metal pin (head + shaft) is 80mm. 

3. Finally, there's a chamfer on the head of the pin, on the top of it. In other words, if the pin was sitting on its head with the shaft in the sky, the chamfered edge of the head would be towards the ground. The chamfer is 2mm in size (the edge length of the chamfer)."
