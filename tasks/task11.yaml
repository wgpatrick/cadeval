description: "We're making an eye bolt. The eyebolt is a torus with a cylinder extruded out of it to make the shank of the bolt. 

1: For the torus, the inner diameter is 20mm and the outer diameter is 30mm. 

2: For the cylindrical shank, the length is 50mm and the diameter is 5mm.  

3: At the end of the shank, away from from the torus, add a 1mm chamfer on the bottom edge of the shank. 

Make sure the shank and the circular eyebolt torus are connected. It's all one part."
