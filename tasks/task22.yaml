description: "This is turned part that has a head and a shank. It's a fairly specific shape and I'll give you some step by step instructions. 

1. First make a cylindrical head. The cylinder is 40mm in diameter (XY plane) and 15mm tall (Z). 

2. Next make a cylindrical shank centered on top of the cylinder. The shank is 15mm diameter (XY) and 80mm tall (Z). 

3. Create a filleted edge between the shank and the head of radius 5mm.

4. Cut a hole (3mm diameter) through the center of the entire part (in Z dim)

5. Chamfer the top of the shank. The chamfer edge length should be 2mm."
