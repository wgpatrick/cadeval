description: "This is a 3mm thickness rectangular plate. The plate is 18mm x 32mm in dimension. 

When looking down at the plate, it has two holes that are drilled through it. 

In the bottom left of the plate, there’s a hole with a centerpoint that is 3mm from the short (18mm) side and 3 mm from the long (32mm) side. This hole has a diameter of 2mm

In roughly the top left corner of plate, there’s a hole of diameter 3mm. It’s center point is 8mm from the short side (18mm side) and 6mm away from the long (32mm) side."
